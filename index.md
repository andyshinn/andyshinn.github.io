## About Me

![](assets/images/andy_320.png)

I work with infrastructure hosting services and open source tooling to help business manage their application lifecycles in the cloud. I love building continuous integration and testing plans, deployment pipelines, monitoring and alerting scenarios, physical to cloud migration strategies, and everything containers.
